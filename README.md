#Title of Project: The effect of exchange rate depreciation on trade balance. The case of Mongolia

#Abstract
For resource-rich developing economies, the effect of real exchange rate depreciation on trade balance may differ from the standard findings depending on country specific characteristics. This article employs vector error correction model to examine the effect of real exchange rate on trade balance in Mongolia, a resource-rich developing country. Empirical results show that exchange rate depreciation improves trade balance in both short and long run. The results suggest that the exchange rate flexibility may help to deal exchange rate risk.
